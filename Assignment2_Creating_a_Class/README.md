## I've chosen to create 'Student' Class  

> ### StudentClass.py  
> The class has four required attributes to pass and 1 optional attribute `on_internship` , which is `None` by default. The class has two methods: `display_info()` and `is_writing()`  

> ### StudentClassObjs.py  
> This is the actual main file with all the required testings included in it.
